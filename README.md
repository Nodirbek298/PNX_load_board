- [Frontend framework TBD]

# Milestone 1 - Initial Planning & Architecture
It will be implemented with python backed restful api with a web frontend.

## Phase 1.1 - Technology Stack Decision
- [x] Decide on database type (SQL, NoSQL) - **Decided: PostgreSQL**
- [x] Choose backend framework - **Decided: FastAPI**
- [x] Choose frontend framework - **Decided: React with TypeScript**
- [x] Select authentication method - **Decided: JWT**
- [x] Choose deployment platform - **Decided: Local Server**

## Phase 1.2 - System Design
